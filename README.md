## MODE Data Challenge 
The challenge is open to everyone, however only workshop participants will be eligible for prizes.  To participate in the data challenge, either register for the event, or send an email to the organizers with your name. In the end we will invite everyone to give a short summary slide of their approach, which will then be discussed at the workshop and distributed to non-registrants. 

### The setting
A scenario for an initial manned mission to Mars involves a 400-day cruise phase to and from the planet.  The cruise phase poses a significant problem due to the cumulative effects of exposure to cosmic and solar radiation.  This challenge remains unresolved.
 
### The physics
Without the protection of earth's magnetosphere, the astronauts aboard future missions to Mars will be shielded only by the spacecraft itself.  A dose of 100 milliSieverts per year is known to increase cancer risk and other illnesses.  Radiation workers on earth are limited to 50 mSv per year.  Six months aboard the ISS exposes a crewmember to 72 mSv, dangerously close to the limit.

The aluminum walls of the ISS provide some protection.  However, thin aluminum shielding causes a net increase in interplanetary space due to absorption and emission of secondary radiation.  Thicker shielding would be needed to block secondary radiation.

The radiation hazard comes from two sources:  1.  Galactic cosmic rays, which are isotropic, and 2.  Solar protons, which emanate radially from the sun. 
 
### The task
Your task is to develop the lightest spacecraft possible while keeping the total 400-day astronaut exposure to under 100 mSv.  The internal spacecraft volume must be 100m3.  The hull material, thickness, and shape are up to you. 

Beyond the 100mSv and 100m3 limits, you are free to design the spacecraft as you choose.  You can use a cylinder, sphere, or other shape.  You can use a single material or layers of different materials.  Considerations for creativity will be given in the scoring.

### The dataset
The dataset consists of particle fluences from galactic cosmic rays and solar protons.   Conversion formulas between fluence and absorbed dose are also provided.
 
### The organization
The competition is open to submissions prior to the workshop.  There will be a dedicated session for solutions at the workshop, with prizes awarded on the final day.

The competition opens on 21 March 2025.  Submissions must be uploaded by 23:59:59 CEST on 8 June 2025. Details of the submission process can be found in the data challenge repository.

You may work in teams or individually.  Discussion with other participants, as well as multiple submissions, are allowed and encouraged.  When making a submission from a team, please specify a team representative.

We have a dedicated discord server to discuss the data challenge.  Please ask the organizers for an invitation. Post there any questions you have, or ideas you want to share.  We’ll also use the server to post important information and updates.

 
### The scoring
Points will be awarded for three criteria:
1.	Technical score – 10 points.  This is determined by the mass of your solution.  Lighter spacecraft will be awarded more points.
2.	Creativity and execution – 10 points
3.	People’s choice – 10 points.  A ballot box for voting will be open to workshop participants throughout the day after the presentation session.

### The starter pack
We have provided you with datasets to quickly get started with the challenge, a sample code to import this data into python, and a pdf document to provide more detailed information. Particle fluences are available in the "fluences" folder.  The introduction slides are named "Mode 2025 Data Challenge.pdf".

### Submissions
Participants must send an email to the workshop organizers at mode-workshop-organizers@cern.ch .  They will then send you an invitation to the discord server.

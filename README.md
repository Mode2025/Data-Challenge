## MODE Data Challenge 
The challenge is open to everyone, however only workshop participants will be eligible for prizes.  To participate in the data challenge, either register for the event, or send an email to the organizers with your name. In the end we will invite everyone to give a short summary slide of their approach, which will then be discussed at the workshop and distributed to non-registrants. 

### The setting
A scenario for an initial manned mission to Mars involves a 400-day cruise phase to and from the planet.  The cruise phase poses a significant problem due to the cumulative effects of exposure to cosmic and solar radiation.  This challenge remains unresolved.
 
### The physics
Without the protection of earth's magnetosphere, the astronauts aboard future missions to Mars will be shielded only by the spacecraft itself.  A dose of 100 milliSieverts per year is known to increase cancer risk and other illnesses.  Radiation workers on earth are limited to 50 mSv per year.  Six months aboard the ISS exposes a crewmember to 72mSv, dangerously close to the limit.

The aluminum walls of the ISS provide some protection.  However, thin aluminum shielding causes a net increase in interplanetary space due to absorption and emission of secondary radiation.  Thicker shielding would be needed to block secondary radiation.

The radiation hazard comes from two sources:  1.  Galactic cosmic rays, which are isotropic, and 2.  Solar protons, which emanate radially from the sun. 
 
### The task
Your task is to develop the lightest spacecraft possible while keeping the total 400-day astronaut exposure to under 100 mSv.  The internal spacecraft volume must be 100m3.  The hull material, thickness, and shape are up to you. 

Beyond the 100mSv and 100m3 limits, you are free to design the spacecraft as you choose.  You can use a cylinder, sphere, or other shape.  You can use a single material or layers of different materials.  Considerations for creativity will be given in the scoring.

### The dataset
The dataset consists of particle fluences from galactic cosmic rays and solar protons.   Conversion formulas between fluence and absorbed dose are also provided.
 
### The organization
The competition will run prior to the workshop, in order to allow you to focus on the presentations during the workshop. There will be a dedicated session to present the various solutions.  Prizes will be awarded at the end of the workshop.

The competition opens on 14 February 2025 and submissions must be uploaded by 23:59:59 CET on 8 June 2025. Details of the submission process are in the data challenge repository.

Multiple submissions are allowed and encouraged; only your latest submission will be scored.  You may work in teams or individually, and otherwise discuss amongst yourselves. Please note, however, that only one copy of each prize can be awarded to an entry, whether it be from a team or individual. Additionally, when making a submission from a team, please nominate someone to submit in their own name.

We have a dedicated Slack channel to discuss the data challenge. Please ask the organizers for an invitation, and then search for the “2025-design-challenge” channel. Post here any questions you have, or ideas you want to share. We will also use this to post important information and updates.
 
### The scoring
Points will be awarded for three criteria:
1.	Technical score – 10 points.  This is determined by the mass of your solution.  Lighter spacecraft will be awarded more points.
2.	Creativity and execution – 10 points
3.	People’s choice – 10 points.  A ballot box for voting will be open to workshop participants throughout the day after the presentation session.

### The starter pack
We have provided you with datasets to quickly get started with the challenge, and a pdf document to provide more detailed information. Particle fluences are available in the "fluences" folder.  The introduction slides are named "Mode 2025 Data Challenge.pdf".

### Submissions
Participants must send an email to the workshop organizers at mode-workshop-organizers@cern.ch .  They will then send you an invitation to the discord server.
